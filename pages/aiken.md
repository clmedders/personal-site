#  Aiken Coffee House and Lounge

The Aiken Coffee House and Lounge is an exciting business venture that would to create a cozy and welcoming atmosphere for customers while being environmentally conscious. As part of my project, I have utilized my skills in CSS, HTML, and a little bit of JavaScript to develop a website that showcases the unique features of this lounge.

One of the key highlights of the Aiken Coffee House and Lounge is its focus on being mother nature-friendly. To reflect this, no paper product would be used and everything would be in the thought of mother nature

In terms of the website's layout, I have utilized HTML to create a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for visitors to navigate through the different sections of the site. I have also included a menu page that displays the lounge's offerings in an organized and visually appealing manner. Additionally, I have incorporated some JavaScript functionality to create a dynamic scrolling effect that enhances the user experience.

Overall, my project highlights the unique features of the Aiken Coffee House and Lounge and showcases my skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in web development and design while also exploring my passion for environmentally friendly businesses. If given the opportunity, starting a business like the Aiken Coffee House and Lounge would be a dream come true for me, and I am excited to see how my skills can contribute to its success.
