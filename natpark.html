          This was my first ever landing page I was able to create.  During my progress on the Odin Project about halfway through this was the first major project that was given.  The cool part about this whole thing is my first page at this was just trash.  It was odd colors, and I just threw some stuff on a screen and called it a day.

          But lucky for me when I sent this over to some people for feedback someone said… hey you can do better. Luckily that’s what I feel like I did.  The reason why I did a landing page on national parks is I just like to be outside.  My goal (if I can ever do it) is to go to all the national parks and it was the first thing I could think of to make a page about.

          During this project I was able to use Sass… which is a cool way to use CSS.  During this time I was able to learn how to install and set up my style sheets.  The cool part of Sass is that I don't have to have a stylesheet that 300 lines long but broken up in to files for each compotant of my project.
