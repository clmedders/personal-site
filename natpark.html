          This was my first ever landing page I was able to create.  During my progress on the Odin Project about halfway through this was the first major project that was given.  The cool part about this whole thing is my first page at this was just trash.  It was odd colors, and I just threw some stuff on a screen and called it a day.

          But lucky for me when I sent this over to some people for feedback someone said… hey you can do better. Luckily that’s what I feel like I did.  The reason why I did a landing page on national parks is I just like to be outside.  My goal (if I can ever do it) is to go to all the national parks and it was the first thing I could think of to make a page about.

          During this project I was able to use Sass… which is a cool way to use CSS.  During this time I was able to learn how to install and set up my style sheets.  The cool part of Sass is that I don't have to have a stylesheet that 300 lines long but broken up in to files for each compotant of my project.

          One of the coolest parts was my first pass at this project looked very, very, very bad… however I believe that once you look at what I was able to come up with you’ll be impressed and see how proud I am of my work.

          I was told that the best front-end developers... are the best con artist.  The goal is to recreate the design that you are given. This really was the best first experience to be given a design and then asked to recreate it.
