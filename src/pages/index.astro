				Welcome to my site, I hope that you came here excited and ready to go! The purpose of this mix of content, styles and scripting is to give you a chance to learn more about me and see what work I might have done or even currently working on. There will be a mix of blogs, maybe some YouTube videos and a few brain dumps that might not make any sense. However if you would be so kind as to check what you think is intresting I would be very happy.
				<br>
				<br>
				With that being said please feel free to click around and see projects I have worked on both personally and professionally.
